[Live demo](https://project-osrm.github.io/osrm-frontend-v2)

This is a rewrite of the frontend for OSRM as discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-frontend/issues/51).

Please note that ```gh-pages``` is the **stable branch** (e.g. what we serve as public frontend) and ```master``` the **unstable** development branch.

This is very much **WIP**.
